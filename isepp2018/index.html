                        Detonation, Environmental Sustainability, Combustion, Emissions, Advanced Diagnostics etc. The
                        program will comprise of a number of invited/plenary talks, panel sessions, a poster session and
                        a session on research-in-progress. More than 150 delegates (International/ National) are
                        expected to participate in this workshop. The workshop sponsors include ONR Global, NSF and
                        DRDO. We also intend to collaborate with Springer and Begell House to bring out the
                        proceedings in the form of a Research Monograph.

                    <h1>TBRL Chandigarh</h1>
                    <p class="text-justify margin-top-20">
                        Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL) was envisaged in 1961 as one of the armament
                        research laboratory, under the Department of Defence Research & Development with an aim to
                        provide facilities for applied research and technology development in the fields of high
                        explosives, detonics, shock & blast, lethality, impact & penetration performance evaluation of
                        warheads & other armament systems. The laboratory became fully operational in 1967 and was
                        formally inaugurated in January 1968 by the then Defence Minister. The laboratory has the
                        headquarter at Sector 30, Chandigarh. The TBRL ranges are divided into number of technical zones
                        / trial areas which have been designed and spaced so as to allow conduct of experimental trials
                        independent of each other. Each technical zone has been equipped with highly specialized
                        instruments and diagnostic facilities, which generate critical inputs for the design and
                        development of warheads and armament systems. The main feature of the trial areas is that the
                        instruments are kept in the strong RCC bunkers and explosive or ammunition are detonated in the
                        open. Over the last 50 years the laboratory has evolved from a test and evaluation center to an
                        institute with expertise and competence in technology development, simulation, design and
                        development of different explosive devices and related systems for armament applications.
