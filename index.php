                <p> <small>National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra is organizing an <b>International Workshop on Energy, Power and Environment (IWEPE-2019)</b> during<b> March 17-19, 2019</b>. This event will be organized in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, University of Maryland, College Park, University of Illinois at Chicago, Analytic & Computational Research Inc. USA. This is the 10th in a series of workshops on the broad theme of Energy, Power and Propulsion that started in 2004 with a review of the Status of Combustion in India and has evolved into a forum for the status of Sustainable Energy Development for Power and Propulsion worldwide.<br/>
                For this year, the general theme is Clean Energy Production & Utilization. We expect to have contributions from world-renowned experts on topics that include Power, Propulsion, Pulse Detonation, Environmental Sustainability, Combustion, Emissions, Advanced Diagnostics etc. The program will comprise  a number of invited/plenary talks, panel sessions, a poster session and a session on research-in-progress. More than 150 delegates (International/ National) are expected to participate in this workshop. </small> </p>
