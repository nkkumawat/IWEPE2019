                <p> <small>National Institute of Technology (NIT) Kurukshetra and Terminal Ballistic Research Laboratory (TBRL) Chandigarh, are jointly organizing an International Workshop on Sustainable Energy, Power and Propulsion (ISEPP-2018) to be held at National Institute of Technology (NIT), Kurukshetra during March 18-22, 2018. This event will be organized in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, University of Maryland, College Park, University of Illinois at Chicago, Analytic & Computational Research Inc. USA. This is the 9th in a series of workshops on the broad theme of Energy, Power and Propulsion that started in 2004 with a review of the Status of Combustion in India and has evolved into a forum for the status of Sustainable Energy Development for Power and Propulsion worldwide.<br/>
                For this year, the general theme is Clean Energy Production & Utilization. We expect to have contributions from world-renowned experts on topics that include Power, Propulsion, Pulse Detonation, Environmental Sustainability, Combustion, Emissions, Advanced Diagnostics etc. The program will comprise of a number of invited/plenary talks, panel sessions, a poster session and a session on research-in-progress. More than 150 delegates (International/ National) are expected to participate in this workshop. The workshop sponsors include ONR Global, NSF and DRDO. We also intend to collaborate with Springer and Begell House to bring out the proceedings in the form of a Research Monograph.</small> </p>
